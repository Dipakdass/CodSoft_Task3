# Iris Flower Classification Project

This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used for this classification task is the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of 150 iris flowers, divided into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.


## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of the following attributes:

Sepal length (in cm)

Sepal width (in cm)

Petal length (in cm)

Petal width (in cm)

Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)
## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

Python (>=3.6)

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

You can install the required packages using pip:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
## Methodology

1. Data Loading: Load the Iris dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
3. Data Visualization: Explore the dataset through various visualizations to understand the relationships between different features.
4. Model Training: Train the selected model on the dataset.
5. Model Selection: Choose an appropriate classification algorithm.
6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics.
7. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model for predictions.
## Results

The trained model achieves an accuracy of approximately 98% on the test set.
## Future Work

Experiment with different classification algorithms to potentially improve accuracy.

Gather additional features that might enhance the model's predictive power.

Deploy the model as a web application or REST API for real-time predictions.
